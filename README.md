WIP - codebase under development

```
python train_denoiser.py --config conf/linear_denoise.yaml
```
from within src. Though the environment needs to be set up first, instructions mostly in new_env_todo.yml .

Modify args in yaml.

See stuff in wandb you need to have an account and put it like denisa-roberts for me in yaml.
